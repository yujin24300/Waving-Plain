# Waving-Plain

## Overview
This project implements a dynamically animated plane with wave and rotation effects using OpenGL and GLSL shaders. The plane responds to keyboard inputs for interactive control over animation, tessellation, and wave parameters.

## Features
- **Checkerboard Plane**: Renders a dynamically tessellated checker-patterned plane using the `MyPlain` class, with vertices, colors, and buffers managed in C++ and drawn via OpenGL.
- **Wave Effect**: Press [w] to toggle a center-originating, time-based sine wave effect applied **entirely in the vertex shader**. The wave amplitude exponentially decays with distance from the center.
- **Interactive Animation**: Press [Space] to start/stop **continuous counter-clockwise rotation** (around z-axis) and **waving** of the plane. Animation is time-synchronized and pauses/resumes on key press.
- **Dynamic Tessellation**: Press [1] to **increase** and [2] to **decrease** the number of divisions in the plane, updating the mesh resolution in real time.
- **Quit**: Press [q] to exit the application.

## Implementation Details
- **Main loop**: Handles OpenGL initialization, window creation, and event loop.
- **MyPlain class**: Manages plane geometry, buffer allocation, and shader data binding.
- **Shaders**: Vertex shader applies wave/rotation; fragment shader calculates color from z-value.
- **Wave calculation**: `sin(frequency * distance + time) * amplitude * exp(-distance)`, clamped beyond threshold.
- **Rotation**: 90Â° x-axis tilt + z-axis rotation (time-based).
- **Colors**: Normalized |z| * 4 to intensify orange/blue interpolation.
